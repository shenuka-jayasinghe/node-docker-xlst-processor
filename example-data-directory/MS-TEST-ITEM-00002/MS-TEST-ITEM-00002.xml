                                in an administrative office around 2200 BC.</seg>

                            <seg type="para">The full translation of the laconic text runs as follows:<lb/>
                                <lb/> 18 jars of pig fat – Balli.<lb/> 4 jars of pig fat –
                                Nimgir-ab-lah.<lb/> Fat dispensed (at ?) the city of Zabala.<lb/>
                                Ab-kid-kid, the scribe.<lb/> 4th year 10th month.</seg>

                            <seg type="para">There are plenty of uncertainties about this translation. We
                                cannot be sure that the personal names Balli, Ningir-ablah and Ab-kid-kid
                                are correctly transcribed because of the multivalence of cuneiform signs at
                                this date. Moreover, there are no verbs to tell us whether Balli and
                                Nimgir-ablah were receiving pig fat or handing it out. The fat was either
                                poured out at Zabala or for Zabala, an ancient city of central Sumer whose
                                patron deity was the goddess Inana, identified with the mounds of Ibzeikh.
                                The tablet may have been written at Zabala, but it is also possible it was
                                written at, and was rediscovered in, the even more important city of Umma
                                further to the east. To decide this we need to take account of other similar
                                documents.</seg>

                            <seg type="para">There are several clues in this short text which allow us to
                                position it in an archival context, and comparison. Tablets dated by year
                                and month (no day, and no ‘year-name’ which was the better attested
                                practice) are known to belong late in the decades of the Dynasty of Akkad
                                which ruled south Mesopotamia in the twenty-third and twenty-second
                                centuries BC. While very few such ‘mu-iti’ (year-month) tablets have been
                                recovered in archaeological excavations, plenty appeared on the antiquities
                                market in the early decades of the twentieth century and are scattered among
                                the museums of the western world, including the Louvre, the British Museum,
                                Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh, St Petersburg, Yale and Chicago. A study
                                of these texts was included in B. R. Foster’s work <hi rend="italic">Umma in
                                    the Sargonic period</hi> (Hamden CT, 1982), especially Chapter 4. He
                                discusses numerous tablets which record the issue of food stuffs and other
                                commodities. He writes “animal fats were an important part of human diet”,
                                lard “was stored in jars, and issued by the sìla [ca. 1 litre]”. … “It may
                                also have been an important commercial product, as stocks of it were kept in
                                various cities outside of Umma itself and records kept at Umma as to what
                                was on hand or disbursed in those cities” (pp. 116–70).</seg>
                            <seg type="para">This reads very aptly for our tablet, and that it is relevant
                                becomes apparent when we find that one of his texts mentions Balli, another
                                records Zabala as the place where the pig fat was used, and a third tablet
                                concerned with pig fat mentions an Ab-kid-kid. Here he is the scribe, and
                                Balli and Nimgir-ab-lah must be receiving, issuing, or authorizing the issue
                                of the pig fat. While Nimgir-ablah is new to us, Balli turns up regularly in
                                the texts discussed by Foster, and he seems to be an official in charge of a
                                wide range of oils, from pig fat and butter to sesame oil and almond oil. It
                                is virtually certain that this little tablet was clandestinely excavated
                                some time early in the twentieth century, and found its way to Europe along
                                with many other tablets from an institutional archive—a palace or
                                conceivably also a temple. As for its more precise date, this is still sub
                                judice, but along with the rest of its archive it probably belongs to a time
                                when Shar-kali-sharri, the last king of the Dynasty of Akkad, had lost
                                control of parts of the south, and documents at Umma were no longer dated by
                                his regnal years, but by another system. Unfortunately we don’t know what
                                the starting point for the ‘4th year’ was.</seg>
